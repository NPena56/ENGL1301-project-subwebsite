                <p>I think something that helped me learn about me was when one of my grandparents passed away. It made me isolate myself from people for a while. This was a hard time for me and I had to-do alot of looking at myself to heal. So this helped teach me alot about myself I did not know. Journaling was one of those things that helped just writing down thoughts.</p>
