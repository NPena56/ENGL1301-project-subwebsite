                <p>I think one of the things that would kind of bother me in a sense was well I've told you how I had to spend my summers. Sometimes we would write papers on places and experiences that I never got to have as a kid because my parents weren't the most fortuante so ghrowiung up I didn't get alot of experiences other people got to have at a younger age. Sometimes I just had to make the writing up and work with what I had.</p>
