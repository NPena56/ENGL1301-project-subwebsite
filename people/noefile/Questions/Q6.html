                     <p>I have seen that not everybody has the same advantages as others some come from more fortunate backgrounds and some from less.
                         What you do with your life will take you to where you end up not your background. Some people will have it harder than others
                         though some people might have to fight certain disabilities when trying to complete a task or some people might have some sort of mental handicap. 
                         Some people might have it easier than others. Some people might have a drive and a passion for workload and just grinding out work. 
                        Some people might have greater physical performance than others. Everybody has their positives and negatives.</p>
